In the Factory method pattern,

•	You can use parameters to determine which instance you want to get.

•	You don’t know what instance you are going to get. You may get sub-instances rather than always parent instances.

•	You don’t see the instantiation logic. That means you don’t know how the instantiation happens. You only see what you get.

•	Even though those higher classes may reference interfaces or concrete classes or any other, you don’t need to be aware of what those classes implement or inherit.

•	Usually, use a higher level of frameworks that are invoked in the lower level by developers/end users.
