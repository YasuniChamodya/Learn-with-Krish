Do you need to achieve loose coupling in your design? In other words, do you need to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver? If your answer is ‘Yes’, let’s learn the Chain of Responsibility design pattern which encourage loose coupling. There, a particular request from a client is passed to a chain of objects to handle/process them. But the important point is that the sender does not know who the receiver is and the receiver does not know who the sender is. Therefore sender can perform its job without knowing the receiver who is going to receive the results and the receiver can perform its job without knowing who sent the request. In summary, you can decouple the sender and receiver with the Chain of Responsibility design pattern. Also, the most important thing to mention here is that you can change the order of senders and receivers very easily in your program without touching the core implementation even after deployment. Let’s learn how.
